	<h1>Hi, I'm Leopold Spanovic <small><em>(shorter: Leo or Smuk3c)</em></small></h1>
	<p><strong>A digital nomad traveling the globe with my family.</strong> Raised in the entrepreneurial spirit and I don't know any other way. In last ten years, I failed a company <em>(I learned so much from this)</em>, tried infinite startup projects, and finally successfully sold one of my businesses. <strong>At that point,</strong> I realized that working for money is not worth the hustle. And since then I am investing 80% of my business time into my passion - <strong>helping people grow</strong>.
