This GitHub repository is my personal GitHub page on which you can find more information about me, my skills, my goals. You can even track my progress on a blog which is part of this website.*This project was built with the help of GitHub pages and Jekyll.*

**There are still some things left to do**

* Finish goals page
* Make your CV page
* Write a blog about making github pages

*Inspired by [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)*
