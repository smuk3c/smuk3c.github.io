This GitHub repository is my personal GitHub page on which you can find more information about me, my skills, my goals. You can even track my progress on a blog which is part of this website. 

*This project was built with the help of GitHub pages and Jekyll. Inspired by [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)*
