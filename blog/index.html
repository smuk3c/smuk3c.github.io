<p>I am dedicating blog to the coding part of my life. <em>There is also one more for business and motivation you can find <a href="https://www.tinystories.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em> In the end, this page is hosted on GitHub and one of my goals is to give back to the community, and I have to admit as a developer with 8+ years of experience I didn't give much back. This is going to change.</p>
