# Daily routine beta

**EDIT: 26.11.2017 -** I tried to control all my day in one strike. It's not possible at moment. So I am going back to basics to build my condidence again. I am going to add one thing in ritual each day. And try to keep it going. I am starting with most important one.

* **20:00 - 21:00** -- Organization *Every day* 

<strike>
**Improvements based on results...*

* **10:00 - 4:00** -- Sleeping time *I wish I woudn't need sleep*
* **04:00 - 5:00** -- Waking up routine
* **5:00 - 6:00** -- Writing block
* **6:00 - 7:00** -- Learning block
* **7:00 - 8:00** -- Family time
* **08:30 - 12:30** -- Deep Working block
