* My daily routine get's update - or we can say downgrade. At this point, I was not able to control all my day, and it ended that I wasn't even writing my daily logs as planned. So I am going back to basics. I am setting only one thing that I want to do every day at the same time. And when I feel confident again I am going to add a new one.
* Freelance work is going well. I am happy that I work in a team which gives me challenges so I can learn something new each day.
* I finally did a task that was waiting for me for a long time. At same time proud and angry I didn't do it before...
