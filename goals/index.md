# 10 Micro achievements of 2018
*Five years ago I set my goals for the long term. This time I am testing a different approach. I will go for micro-achievements which I want to materialize in the year 2018. The hypothesis is that they will bring me more joy because they will be reachable in shorter time frame.* 

**Discloure:** *I still know where I am heading to. I just remove items from agenda for one year. After this period, I am going to bring it back or set a new set of micro goals based on results.*

**Progress:** 0/10 achieved
